## Adding a code chunk 
```{r}

 W <- function(a, L, b) {
  
  a * (L) ^ b
  
}

milkfish <- W(a = 0.0905, 
             L = 60,
             b = 2.52)

giant_trev <- W(a = 0.0353,
                L = 60,
                b = 3.05)

great_bar <- W(a = 0.0181,
               L = 60,
               b = 3.27)

```

## Now I am making a sequence for fish length
```{r}

fish_length <- seq(from = 0, to = 200, by = 1)

```

## Estimate giant barracuda weight
```{r}

barracuda_weight <- W(a = 0.0181,
                      b = 3.27,
                      L = fish_length)

```

## Bind the lengths and estimate barracuda lengths
```{r}

great_bar_df <- data.frame(fish_length, barracuda_weight)
```

## Create giant barracuda graph
```{r}

ggplot(data = great_bar_df, aes(x = fish_length, y = barracuda_weight)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Barracuda Length (cm)",
       y = "Barracuda Weight (g)",
       title = "Barracuda Length and Weight in Hawaiian Estuaries")
 

```
